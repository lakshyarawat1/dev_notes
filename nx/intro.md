# NX 

## Introduction

- NX is a set of tools and libraries for building and managing monorepos. It provides a powerful CLI, a set of plugins for popular frameworks, and a rich ecosystem of tools for managing dependencies, running tasks, and generating code.
- It is used to make monorepo projects.

## Features

- **Monorepo**: NX is designed to work with monorepos, which are repositories that contain multiple projects. This allows for better code sharing and collaboration between teams.

- **Plugins**: NX has a rich ecosystem of plugins for popular frameworks like Angular, React, and NestJS. These plugins provide additional functionality and make it easier to work with these frameworks in a monorepo.

## Command Line Interface (CLI)

### Creating a Workspace

- To create a new NX workspace, you can use the following command:
```bash
npx create-nx-workspace@latest myworkspace
```
- This will create a new NX workspace in a directory called `myworkspace`. You can also specify a different name for the workspace by replacing `myworkspace` with your desired name.

### Creating a New Application

- To create a new application in your NX workspace, you can use the following command:
```bash
nx generate @express/react:application myapp
```
