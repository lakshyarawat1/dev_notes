# Typescript

## Introduction

- Superset of JavaScript
- Developed by Microsoft
- Strongly typed (static typing)
- Created by Anders Hejlsberg (C# creator)

## Need for Typescript

- JavaScript is not strongly typed 
- Reduces runtime errors

## Compilation

- Typescript code is compiled to JavaScript code
- Command is `tsc filename.ts`
- Returns the compiled JavaScript code in `filename.js`

## Features

### Static Type Checking

- Typescript checks for types at compile time
- Typescript can infer the type of a variable based on the value assigned to it

### Non-exception Failures

- 

## Types

- Explicit declaration of types syntax `let variableName: type = value`
- Typescript can infer the return type of a function based on the attributes / parameters
